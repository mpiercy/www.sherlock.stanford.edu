In order to use Matlab on Sherlock we need to verify that your PI group has a current Matlab license, 
either purchased from Stanford, or from MathWorks directly.

To see if you are in this group type "id" on the command line on Sherlock, if you see sw_matlab you can 
run Matlab on Sherlock.

```
$ id
uid=28622(mpiercy) gid=32264(ruthm) groups=32264(ruthm),98009(**sw_matlab**),99001(sh_users)
```
 If you are not on the sw_matlab group, check here for purchasing info:
